## Description

Cucumber, Cucumis sativus, is a warm season, vining, annual plant in the family Cucurbitaceae grown for its edible cucumber fruit. The cucumber plant is a sprawling vine with large leaves and curling tendrils. The plant may have 4 or 5 main stems from which the tendrils branch. The leaves of the plant are arranged alternately on the vines, have 3â€“7 pointed lobes and are hairy. The cucumber plant produces yellow flowers that are 4 cm (1.6 in) in diameter. The cucumber fruit varies in shape but is generally a curved cylinder rounded at both ends that can reach up to 60 cm (24 in) in length 10 cm (3.9 in) in diameter. Cucumber plants are annual plants, surviving only one growing season and the vines can reach up to 5 m (16.4 ft) in length. Cucumber may also be referred to as gherkin and originates from the foothills of the Himalayas, likely in India.
